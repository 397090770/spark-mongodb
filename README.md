# Spark-Mongodb

Spark-Mongodb is a library that allows the user to read/write data with [Spark SQL](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html)  from/into MongoDB collections.

[MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/ "MongoDB website") provides a documental data model
richer than typical key/value systems. [Spark](http://spark.incubator.apache.org/ "Spark website") is a
fast and general-purpose cluster computing system that can run applications up to 100 times faster than Hadoop.

Integrating MongoDB and Spark gives us a system that combines the best of both
worlds opening to MongoDB the possibility of solving a wide range of new use cases.

## Requirements

This library requires Spark 1.2+
